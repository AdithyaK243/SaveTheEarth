The son of Odin uses his mighty abilities as the God of Thunder to protect his home Asgard and planet Earth alike.He uses **_Mjolnir_**,in Norse mythology is the hammer of Norsegod associated with thunder which has enormous powers of it's own as well. The hammer is made from the heart of a dying star and whoever shall be worthy to lift the hammer will posses the power of Thor.

Thor is also the prince and the future king of Asgard,he uses the hammer only to channel his power and focus it.EVen after he loses the hammer to **Hela** ,the godess of death he manages to defeat her with his powers alone.
He wields the power of the ancient Asgardians to fight evil throughout the Nine Realms and beyond.As a god,he ages at an incredibly slow pace which basically makes him live for a millenia.He also posseses the speed ,strength,durability of a divine warrior and is among the strongest beings in the universe.
Thor is a gifted combatant.His ancient skills and exprience in combat pair with his enormous might to make him one of the finest fighters in the universe.


Although he is not recognised for his powers, he is the **Strongest Avenger**.As he was the only person who was able to bring the mad titan,**Thanos** on his knees with his powers and his axe **Stormbreaker**,while everyone else who stood against him were turned into dust.

During the **Convergence**, which occurs every 5000 years where the walls between the 7 realms diminish ,when the dark elves tried to conquer the realms ,Thor defeated _Malekith_,the dark elves leader with the power of thunder and the almighty  _Mjolnir_. This all happened after the fight of **_Avengers_** in New York,after which Loki was imprisoned in the dungeons of **Asgard**.
